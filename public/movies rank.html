<h1>The Best Movies According to Logan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith</h3>
<p>This is my all time favorite movie, I used to watch it a ton as a kid</p>
<h3>Tron</h3>
<p>This movie is just so nostalgic and electric all around. Bikes that leave plasma trails that can eliminate people? Awesome</p>
<h3>Space Balls</h3>
<p>The shock value of this movie is why it has this spot, thought it was gonna be a Star Wars until I saw Pizza the Hut</p>
